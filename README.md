# TrustDoc
A distributed, encrypted document management system built from scratch in Go, with no external dependencies. Utilizes encryption and zero-trust architecture to ensure secure storage, strict access control, and confidentiality of sensitive documents.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TrustDoc is built as a part of a [blog series](https://blog.ioutil.app), documenting my journey of deepening my knowledge/skills in the areas of networking, de-/encryption, data storage, access control, application design, and, of course, distributed systems. TrustDoc is being actively developed in Go but does not aim to serve a practical use case apart from learning and teaching.
> 
> Therefore, TrustDoc is built with absolutely **zero external dependencies**, even if this means missing certain functionality or subpar implementations in some regards. This is std lib and learning, do with it what you want. ;)
> 
> Through the blog series, I hope to let others participate in learning from the challenges I face and the progress I make on this project.

> If your interested or have questions feel free to contact me. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the journey and stay keen for what is to come.
