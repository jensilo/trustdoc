# TrustDoc
A distributed, encrypted document management system built from scratch in Go, with no external dependencies. Utilizes encryption and zero-trust architecture to ensure secure storage, strict access control, and confidentiality of sensitive documents.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TrustDoc is built as a part of a [blog series](https://blog.ioutil.app). I love from scratch projects as I think they teach you the most. In this case there's a lot to learn, for me, and hopefully for you, about Go, Networking, Distributed Systems, Cryptography, and certainly much more, join me if you're interested!

> TrustDoc does not aim to serve a practical use case apart from learning and teaching. Therefore TrustDoc is built with _zero external dependencies_, even if this means missing certain functionality or subpar implementations.
